# Mind Maps Repository

Welcome to my collection of mind maps! This repository hosts all the mind maps I’ve created, covering various topics like database optimization, troubleshooting, and more. Each mind map is designed to simplify complex concepts with clear, hierarchical structures, often including interactive versions for deeper exploration.

## Purpose

The goal is to share visual, easy-to-understand resources for professionals, students, and enthusiasts. Whether you’re tackling SAP HANA performance issues or exploring other domains, these mind maps aim to provide actionable insights.

## Available Mind Maps

Below is a list of mind maps in this repository. Each includes a brief description and links to interactive or static versions where available.

1. **SAP HANA CPU Utilization Mind Map**  
   - **Description**: Outlines 8 causes of high CPU usage in SAP HANA (e.g., inefficient queries, missing indexes), their fixes (e.g., query optimization, indexing), parameter changes (e.g., `maximum_number_of_sessions`), and SQL views/statements (e.g., `M_SQL_PLAN_CACHE`) for diagnosis.  
   - **Interactive Version**: [hana-cpu-mindmap.html](https://soumyaranjan12.github.io/MindMaps/hana-cpu-mindmap.html) (hosted on GitHub Pages; click nodes to expand details).
